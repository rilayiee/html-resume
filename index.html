        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>I don't have much work experience as I am still a student. However, I am very hardworking and a fast learner as well.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I haven't graduated highschool yet. Here are the list of schools I went to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Araneta Learning Center (ALCCDI)</li>
            <li>Catbalogan V Elementary school</li>
            <li>Samar National School (SNS)</li>
        </ol>
        <hr />
        <h3>Work Experience</h3>
        <p>Just like what I have mentioned earlier, I have not graduated highscool yet, therefore, I don't have any work experience. But that doesn't mean I am not willing to learn. As a student, I am pretty exposed to the computer, so I am pretty familiar with how it works.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>I am very hard working and a fast learner as well. I joined some research competitions during my highschool days, and most of our studies were about applications, programming and coding skills were needed. I studied about them for a bit and understood some parts, however it was a very broad topic so I couldn't really comprehend everything so quickly. But I am willing to learn!</p>
